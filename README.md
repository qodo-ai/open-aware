## 📋 Features

Compare **Open Aware** capabilities with standard agents:

| Category | Open Aware | CLI/Vibe Coding Agents | Why Open Aware is Different |
|----------|------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 🔍 **Advanced context** | ✅ Semantic understanding across entire repositories | ⚠️ Limited to open files/folders | Pre-indexed semantic search vs scanning local files |
| 🤖 **Agentic** | ✅ Researches complex deep architectural tasks | ⚠️ Code completion/generation focused | Answers "broad/deep" not just a "summary of local files" |
| 🛠️ **Aware engine** | ✅ Enterprise code intelligence via MCP | ❌ Consumer-grade autocomplete | Industrial analysis vs IDE suggestions |
| 🚀 **Cross-repo intelligence** | ✅ Analyzes multiple repos simultaneously | ❌ Single repo/workspace only | Understands interactions across repos |
| 🎯 **Up to date** | ✅ Daily indexed popular OSS libraries | ⚠️ Only your local version | Knows latest Flask/React/FastAPI changes globally |

---

## 🔌 Integration with MCP

Both tools are exposed through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, making them easily accessible to any MCP-compatible AI assistant or development environment.

```bash
npm install -g mcp-remote
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-aware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://open-aware.qodo.ai/mcp/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧰 Agents

The open-aware MCP server provides three powerful tools that can be integrated into your AI workflows:

<details>
<summary>
  <b>🔨 Context Retrieval (<code>get_context</code>)</b>
</summary>

<br/>

This tool performs **semantic search** across codebase(s) to find relevant code snippets.

**Key Features:**
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings to find conceptually similar code, not just keyword matches.
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Search across multiple repositories simultaneously.
- **Language Filtering**: Filter results by programming language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.).
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Returns results ranked by relevance with configurable result limits.

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "tool": "get_context",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "authentication middleware implementation",
    "repositories": ["backend/api", "frontend/app"],  // Target specific repos
    "language": ["python", "typescript"],              // Filter by language
    "max_results": 10                                  // Limit number of results
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  <b>🔨 Deep Research (<code>deep_research</code>)</b>
</summary>

<br/>
  
A **deep context agent** that can answer/plan/research complex queries about codebase(s) by analyzing code structure, patterns, and relationships.

**Key Features:**
- **Code Understanding**: Comprehends code logic, architecture, and design patterns.
- **Cross-Repository Analysis**: Can analyze relationships between different parts of your codebase.
- **Implementation Planning**: Helps plan new features based on existing code patterns.
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Suggests improvements based on codebase analysis.
- **Architecture Insights**: Provides high-level understanding of system design.

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "tool": "deep_research",
  "parameters": {
    "input": "How does the authentication flow work across our microservices? What security measures are in place?",
    "repositories": ["backend/api", "frontend/app"],  // Repos to analyze
    "session_id": "analysis-123"                      // Track conversation context
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  <b>🔨 Context Ask (<code>ask</code>)</b>
</summary>

<br/>
  
A **Basic coding questions agent** that accepts query and provides details answer for selected coding repositories.

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "tool": "ask",
  "parameters": {
    "input": "Explain about these repositories",
    "repositories": ["backend/api", "frontend/app"],  // Check impact across repos
    "session_id": "analysis-123"                      // Track conversation context
  }
}
```
</details>

## 🤖 Prompts

Learn how to effectively use Open Aware with these prompt examples:

```note
🚨 NOTE: Adding the repository name in the prompt helps the agent to focus. 
Also, answering queries for repositories that are not in the index will not work. 
See the supported repositories in the "indexed_repositories.json" file.
```

### Example 1: Let your agent reason to select aware tools
```text
Use open-aware to:
<USER_PROMPT>
repositories = ["<ORG/REPO_NAME>"]
```

### Example 2: Specifically use deep-research / get-context
```text
Use deep-research to:
<USER_PROMPT>
repositories = ["<ORG/REPO_NAME>"]
```

```text
Use get-context to:
<USER_PROMPT>
repositories = ["<ORG/REPO_NAME>"]
```

### Example 3: Granular search per repository/repositories
```text
Use open-aware to: 
<USER_PROMPT>
repositories = ["<ORG/REPO_NAME>", "<ORG/REPO_NAME>", ...]
```

## 🔬 Examples

### Comparison Based on Code Behavior

Make informed decisions based on actual implementation rather than just documentation:

```text
use deep_research: 
Investigate repositories ["langchain-ai/langchain", "BerriAI/litellm"]. 
I don't know which one to use for LLM API calling. Create a comparison and help me decide.
```

**Expected Output:** Detailed comparison of both libraries' implementation approaches, performance characteristics, and suitability for your use case.

### Research for Implementation and Planning

Sometimes you need a feature that doesn't exist in a repository. This example shows how to research and plan a contribution:

```text
use deep_research:
Investigate repository ["pallets/flask"], is there capability to manage requests queue?
If not, I'd like to submit a PR for the Flask repo to suggest adding a queue for requests.
Therefore, investigate and plan how to do it and create a .md file plan for me to execute.
```

**What this does:**
1. First, the agent verifies if the requested feature already exists
2. If not, it analyzes the codebase to understand current implementation patterns
3. Creates a detailed plan aligned with the project's architecture
4. Ensures the changes won't break existing functionality

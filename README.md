## 🔨 Available Tools

The open-aware MCP server provides two powerful tools that can be integrated into your AI workflows:

### 1. **Context Retrieval Tool** (`get_context`)
This tool performs semantic search across codebase/s to find relevant code snippets.

**Key Features:**
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector embeddings to find conceptually similar code, not just keyword matches
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Search across multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Language Filtering**: Filter results by programming language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Returns results ranked by relevance with configurable result limits

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "tool": "get_context",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "authentication middleware implementation",
    "repositories": ["backend/api", "frontend/app"],
    "language": ["python", "typescript"],
    "max_results": 10
  }
}
```

### 2. **Deep Research Tool** (`deep_research`)
An deep context agent that can answer / plan / research complex queries about a codebase\s by analyzing code structure, patterns, and relationships.

**Key Features:**
- **Code Understanding**: Comprehends code logic, architecture, and design patterns
- **Cross-Repository Analysis**: Can analyze relationships between different parts of your codebase
- **Implementation Planning**: Helps plan new features based on existing code patterns
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Suggests improvements based on codebase analysis
- **Architecture Insights**: Provides high-level understanding of system design

**Example Usage:**
```json
{
  "tool": "deep_research",
  "parameters": {
    "input": "How does the authentication flow work across our microservices? What security measures are in place?",
    "repositories": ["auth-service", "api-gateway", "user-service"],
    "session_id": "analysis-123"
  }
}
```

### Integration with MCP
Both tools are exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making them easily accessible to any MCP-compatible AI assistant or development environment.
```json
{
  "open-aware": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-remote",
      "https://open-aware.qodo.ai/mcp/"
    ]
  }
}
```
